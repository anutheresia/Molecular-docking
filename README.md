# Data Collection and Preparation:
  - Retrieved ligand structures (e.g., Palmarin) from PubChem in SDF format for downstream analysis.
  - Retrieved protein structures (e.g., 6LZG) from PDB, removing non-protein elements like water, ions, and carbohydrates.
# Preparation and Analysis Tools Used:
  - Utilized tools such as AutoDock Vina and DiscoveryStudio Visualizer for ligand-protein docking simulations and interaction analysis.
  - Applied ADMET analysis using ADMETlab to evaluate ligand properties crucial for drug efficacy.
# Computational Workflow:
  - Prepared ligands and proteins in suitable formats (e.g., PDBQT) for molecular docking simulations.
  - Defined docking parameters and performed molecular dynamics simulations to predict ligand-protein interactions.
  - Analyzed results to identify potential drug candidates targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.

This project integrates bioinformatics tools and computational techniques to explore potential drug candidates targeting the COVID-19 virus, focusing on molecular interactions between ligands derived from natural sources and viral proteins.
